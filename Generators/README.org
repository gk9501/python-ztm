#+title: Generators

* What are they?
Generators are functions that allow us to generate a sequence of values over time. An example is the ~range()~ function.

=NOTE:= All generators are iterable, but not all iterables are generators

* ~yield~ keyword and ~next()~ function
+ The ~yield~ keyword allows us to pause a function, and comes back to it after ~next()~ is called.
+ A function is a generator if it uses the ~yield~ keyword.
+ The ~yield~ keyword keeps track of the value (state), and only keeps the most recent data in memory.
